Menum, he isa God, a Godl Ο mayst thou be good
and gracious to thine: behold four altars3 two to thee,
Daphnis, and two to Phoebus. l will offer two bowls ol
frothed new milk, annually3 and two jars ol lat olives to thee.
ln the first place, Ι will cheer the least with plenty ol
wine, before the fite, if it be winter, and if summer, in the
shade. 1 will pour out ol the vessel, Ariuslan wines, and
new nectar. Damoetas, and Lyctian AEgon shall sing to me.
Alphesiboeus shall imitate the dancing Satyrs. These sacred
ritas shall be ever thine, both when we return the solemn
vows to the nympha, and when we· make a lustration os the
fields. As longas the wildboar shall love the tops of the
monatains3 as longas fish shall like the rivers ; as long a„
bees shall seed upon the wild thyme 3 as long as the Cicodoe,
on the daw, honours with thy name, and praises shall en·
dure. The husbandmen shall mahevows to thee annnally‚
as to Bacchus and Ceres 3 thou also shalt judge them by their
vows.

Mo. What, what gift can I give to thee lor such a song!
sor, neither the whispers of the rising south, nor the dashing
wave upon the shore, nor rivers running among stony vallies,
impart so much delight.

Me. I will give thee, first os all, this brittle pipe. This
pipe taught meto sing, formosum Corydon ardebat Alexin:
the same also, to sing, estjam pecus? on Melit-oei?

Mo. But, Menaleas, take thou this croolr, beautiful with

. oquidistantjoints, nndornamented with brass, which Antige-
nes hns not obtained, though he often ashed it of me, and yet
he was worthy to be loved.
