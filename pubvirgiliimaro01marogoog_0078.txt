Fortunate olel man! therefore thy lands will remain, and ,
great enough for thee, although nuked rock and swump

with their gentle murmur south thee to sleep. From
hence, thou shslt hear the Pruner sing to the breezes under

the high roch: nevertheless, in the rnean while, shall the
cooing wood pigeons, thy delight, nor the turtle, cease te

mean, frorn the lofty elm. e
