M. Dic mihi, Damoeta, cujum pecus? an Meliboei?
D. Non, verum Aegonis: nuper mihi tradidit Aegon.
M. lufelix o semper oves pecus: ipse Neaeram
Dum fouet, ac, neme sibi praeferat illa, veretum
Hic alienus oves eustos bis mulgetin hora: 3
Et succus pecori, et lac subducitur agnis.
D. Parcius ista viris tamen objicienda memento:
Novimus et qui te, transversa tuentibus hircis,
Et quo, sed faciles nymphae risere, sacello.

⁸ This eclogue contains a dispute between two shepherds, ol that
kind which the critica call Amoelaeru lrorn Ἀμοεῖιῗος, mutual, or
alternate. ln this way ol writing, the persons are represented to
speak alternately; the latter always endeavouring to exceed, or at
‘ least equal, what hasbeen said by the former. Mauricas, Damoe-
tas, and Palaemon, are all ieigned characters, and as iar as is known
without any allusion to individua! persons. The intention oi Virgil
seems to have been to imitate aud exceed Theocritus, particularly
the Νομιῒς, which begins almost in the same words. lt is probable,
also, that he did not write this eclogoe till Pollio was adranced ro
the highest honours, 71⁵, Assv.c.
