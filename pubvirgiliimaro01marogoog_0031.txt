¹ Octavius Cesar and Antony, aster dividing the Roman Repub-
lic, becarne the rivals ol each other, and were proceeding to extre-
niities, when a reconciliation took place, which vvas ratitied by the
marriage ol Antony with Octavia, the hall-sister oi Octavius caesar,
who at this time happened to be a widow, and pregnant by her late
husband Marcellus. Pollio appeared on the part of Antony, and
Maecenas on the partos Caesar, and arbitrated the difference be·
tween them. This reconciliation was the cause ol universal
joy. The Sibylline oracles had soretold, that a child wasto be
born about this time, who should rulc the world and establish per·
petual peace. Virgil here supposes the child with which Octavia
was pregnant to be the glorious infant, under whose rule mankind
was to be made happy, and the golden agero return, when fraud

and violence were to be no more. ,This is the subiect oi this Ec· >

ogue‚ which is dedicated to Pollio, who was the particular admirer
and patron of Virgil. Pollio was consul in the year 714, Α. V. C.
when this reconciliation took place3 from which fact, connected
with some internal evidence in the Eclogue itself, there is good rea·
son to believe that this was the year in which it was composed.
