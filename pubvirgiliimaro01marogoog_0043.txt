ECLOGA VI.¹

siturtUS.

Patria Syracosiob dignata est ludere versu
Nostra, nec erubuit sylvas habitare, Thalia.

⁸ The subject oi this Eclogue is, two young Shepherds find Sile·
nus asleep in acave, intoxicated with wine, his garland iallen irom
his head, and his battered pitcher hanging down. Α nymph as-
siste them in binding him with his own garland, stains his tace
with mulberries, and compels him to sing3 upon which the tauns
and wild beasts immediately dante, and the oalrs bend their heads·
ln his Song, Silenus describes the formation oi the universe, and
the original ol animals according to the Epicurean Philosophy, and
then recounts the most surprising transformatione which have hap-
pened in Nature since her birth. This Eclogue was designed as a
oompliment to Syro, the Epicurean, who instructed Virgil and
Varus in the principles ol that Philosophy.

By way of introduction‚ Virgil says, that this Eclogue was iris
first attempt to write in imitation of Tbeocritus ς that he had once
attempted heroic poetry, but Apollo reproved him, and advised
him to tend his sheep.

'’Tbeocritus was of Syracuse, a famous city oi Sicily: Virgil
therefore, writing Bucolica, in imitation ol that Poet, calls thern
Syracusian or Sicilian.
