J am mihi per rupes videor lucosque sonantes

Ire, libet Partho torquere Cydonia comu

spicatas tanquam haec sint nostri medicina furoris, 60
Aut deus ille malis hominum mitescere discat.

J am neque Hamadryades r rursum, nec carmina nobis
Ipsa placent3 ipsae rursum concedite sylvae.

Non illum nostri possunt mutare labores 5

Nec, si frigoribus mediis Hebrumque⁸ bibamus, 65
Sithoniasquet nives hyemis subeamus aquosae,

N ec si, cum moriens alta liber aret in ulmo,

Aethiopumu versemus oves sub sidere Cancri.
Omina vincit Amor, et nos cedamus Amori.

Haec sat erit, divae, ‚vestrum cecinisse poetam, 70
Dum sedet, et gracili fiscellam texit hibisco,

q Partho torquere Cydonio coma spicula. The Parthians and
Cretans were famous archers3 and Cydon is a city ol Crete. Bows
