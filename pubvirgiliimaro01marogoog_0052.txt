ECLOGA VII²

nonnosus, connisos, snrnsrs.

M. Fossis sub arguta consederat ilice Daphnis,
Compulerantque greges Corydon et Thyrsis in unum,
Thyrsis oves, Corydon distentas lacte capellas,

Ambo florentes aetatibus, Arcades ambo,

Et cantare pares, et respondere parati. 5
Huc mihi, dnm ¹teneras defendo a frigore myrtos,

Vir gregis ipse caperdeerraverat3 atque ego Daphnin
Adpicio 3 ille ubi me contra videt: ocius, inquit,

Huc ades, ο Meliboee5 caper tibi salvus, et hoedi 3
Et, si qnid cessare potes, requiesce sub umbra, 10

⁸ ln this Eciogne is represented nn amebean contentiori between
two Shephcrds, Corydon and Thyrsis. They ore described sitting
under a trec,¹ in company with Daphnis, who secms to have been
appointed to jndge between them. Meitboeus bappcning to pass
tbat vray, in quest ot a strayed gost, is spied by Daphnis, who cells
him, and insists on his stnying to bear the dispute.

No particular person appears to be described in this Eciogue.
The subject is wboily pastoral, and Virgil's sole sirn seems to be,
sn imitation ot Theocritus. The verses ot the two contending
Shepherds, reiste entirely to their orm rnral affairs, to iheir own
inendsbips, or to their own smontt. Ἴ
