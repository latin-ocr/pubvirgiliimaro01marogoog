thon fullos honourto thy friends3 after fate took thee away,
Pales herself, and Apollo forsoolr the fields. Often in
those furrows where we have sown fine barlcy, noxiores
darnel, and the wild ont, have prevailed. Instead of the sols
violet, instead of the purple daffodil, thethidis, and the pali·
urus risos with sharp thorns. Shepherds, strew the ground
with leaves, and make a shade for your fountains: Daphnis
orders such things to be done forhim; and malsc a monument
ohim, and put this verse upon it :-I Daphnis, celebrated
from these woods even unto the stars, the shepherd of a beau·
¹ tiful doch, myself more beautiful.

,Me Ο divine poet, thy song is to us, as sound sleep
on the grass to the weary, such as the ripling stream of swoet
water to the thirsty. Nor doest thou equal thy master only
upon the pipe, but with thy voice. Ο happy youth, now
thou shalt benext to him. Yet will we sing these our verses
to thee, in turn, and lift up thy Daphnis to the stars 3 lwill
raise Daphnis to the stars ; Daphnis loved me also.

Mo. Can any thingbe greater to me than such an obliga-

- Me. Now resplendent Daplmis admirer the entrance
of Olympus, and sees the clouds and the stare under
his feet. There ore joyful pleasure possesses the woods,
end all the country3 and Pan, and the Shepherds, and the
Dryad nymphe. No longer does the wolf lie in nait for
she sheep, nor are nets spread toensnare the stags3 good
Daphnis loves peace. The unshorn hills themselves list up
their voices to the stars with joy; already therocksare
softcned with songs3 the vineyards themselves resound3
